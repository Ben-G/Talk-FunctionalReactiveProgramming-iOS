#Functional Reactive Programming on iOS

Most iOS Apps have multiple layers of state. Manually communicating state changes between these layers is error-prone and tends to produce code that is difficult to maintain.

Functional Reactive Programming provides a toolset for *declaring* relationships between different objects, removing the need to implement these relationships manually. Signals, an essential part of FRP, provide a standardized way of working with differnent kinds of future values which makes many design decisions easier.

Incorporating Reactive Cocoa and FRP principles into iOS apps can help to write code that is easier to test, maintain and less likely to produce unexpected results.
